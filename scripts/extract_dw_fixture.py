"""Extract a deterministic real-market fixture slice from ``data/DW`` into parquet.

The observation row and the execution row for one session share the venue close instant: the
closing print is knowable exactly when it prints. A callback earlier in a later session therefore
sees only strictly prior sessions, while an execution or valuation at the close sees that close.

The warehouse under ``data/DW`` is local, gitignored vendor data. This tool turns a small,
explicitly bounded slice of it into the two physical inputs vqapr registers: one observation
dataset and one exact execution input. Nothing here invents prices, calendars, or tradability.

Run it before any showcase or test that requires real inputs::

The warehouse price file cannot tell a share from an ETF -- its sixteen columns are all price,
volume and status, and `상장구분` is a listing-status code rather than a category. So the fixture
cannot discover its own ETFs; it has to be told, and this tuple is where it is told.

**These names join the traded slice and never the benchmark.** An index ETF tracks the index, it
is not a constituent of it, so a weight row for one would make the fixture assert something the
vendor never published. `dw_slice` therefore carries the sleeve while the benchmark query stays
bound to the membership file.

One name is enough and more would not buy anything. What the sleeve exists to prove is that a
venue charges an ETF differently from a share -- KRX exempts the sale tax a share pays -- and a
second ETF exercises the identical branch. Sized to the question, not to the asset class.
