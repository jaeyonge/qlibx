"""The door: a report from a record on disk.

`strategy_report` opens one strategy's record and its four tables through `vqapr.record`
(the same reader `vqapr show strategy --table` uses) and hands the rows to `measure`.
`run_report` does that for every strategy of a run and adds what only the run can answer: the
headline table, the correlation of period returns, and each strategy against a benchmark
strategy of the same run.

`root` is the store -- the `store_root` `vqapr run` prints, `<project>/.vqapr` unless moved --
not the project directory, exactly as for `read_strategy_table`.
