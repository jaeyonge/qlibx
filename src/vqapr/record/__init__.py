"""Freeze a run's own record to disk while it runs, so a later process can read it.

`recorder_rows` lives in memory for the whole run (`run_state.py:65`). A run that crashes leaves
nothing; a run that finishes leaves nothing anyone else can read. Two things follow, and neither is
a convenience:

- **Parallel execution is impossible.** Five processes running five factors each hold their results
  in their own memory, and nobody can read all five afterwards. That is AC-R4.
- **`show run <id>` has nothing to show.** The only way to answer a question about a finished run is
  to run it again. That is AC-R5.

The layout is argued in `docs/design/run-record-layout.md`; the two decisions that shape this
package are repeated here because they are the ones a reader will otherwise try to "simplify".
The tables are parquet since record `146`; see `PART_SUFFIX`.

**A directory scan, not an index file.** An index would put every concurrent writer on one
atomic-replace target, which is exactly the lost-update the workspace lock exists for
(`workspace.py:53-55`): two processes read, both append, the second write erases the first, and
nothing fails. Each run writes only inside its own directory, so two runs cannot collide.

**The writer appends in chunks.** `append` takes a chunk at a time and never re-reads what it
already wrote, so a caller that streams rows as it produces them gets crash survival and bounded
memory for free. Note what the PRODUCT currently does with that: `public.run` hands over
`recorder_rows` once, after the run returns, so today's records are written in one pass at the end.
The chunked interface is what makes streaming possible later; it is not a claim that the run
streams now.

**Persistence is not the execution layer.** This was `flow/record.py` until campaign M6 Step 3.
Reading a record is what a report, a CLI listing and a second process do, and none of them runs
anything -- so the machinery lives above `flow/` and imports nothing from it. The half that DID
need the engine, because it turns a `SimulationResult` into a record, stayed behind as
`run/recording.py`.

Three modules, layered in one direction so the cycle that promotion could have introduced cannot
come back: `schema.py` (what a record is: filenames, models, paths, encodings) is imported by
`reader.py` (what exists, how far it got, the rows back), which is imported by `writer.py`. The
names below are the package's door; everything else is private to the module that holds it.
