"""Adversarial attack on claim 4: run records survive their process, and races are refused.

Four attacks, each stronger than what `tests/run/test_run_records.py` already covers:

1. A run INTERRUPTED mid-write -- a real OS signal to a separate process, not a hand-written
   partial record -- leaves every row it recorded and no `record.json`, and `run_ids` must not
   list it. Since `docs/issues/archive/087` the rows live in memory until the run ends, and an interrupt
   IS an end: the writer's `release` runs on the failure path and writes them.
2. A run hard-KILLED mid-write (`terminate()`, which no code can answer) keeps what the spill
   valve had already forced to disk and loses the rest -- the promise as `087` narrowed it,
   stated here so nobody reads it as the old one.
3. Five processes racing to write the SAME run id concurrently -- the collision must be refused
   (one writer wins, four raise `FileExistsError`), never interleaved into a record that belongs
   to neither.
4. A `record.json` deliberately corrupted after a successful `finish()` -- truncated to invalid
   JSON, and separately, valid JSON that is not a mapping -- and `read_record` must fail loudly
   rather than return a half-answer or silently coerce.

`multiprocessing.spawn` needs picklable top-level functions on Windows, so the interrupted,
killed and racing attacks each drive a standalone script via `subprocess.Popen` instead of
`multiprocessing.Process` with a lambda or closure.
