"""Sentences in the shipped skill that the code no longer backed (`docs/issues/archive/062`, `067`).

The skill is installed from the package, so a sentence in it is a promise the package makes. Two
had drifted: `Hold(reason=...)` was said to take "one token, no spaces" while the docstring and the
validation accepted prose, and an edited component was said to be refused without
`register --force` while no such flag existed and a plain re-register replaced it silently. Each
assertion here is mechanical: the text is checked against the behaviour it describes, in the same
test, so the two cannot drift apart again without this file saying so.
